<h1>About SIREN</h1>
<p>SEN's renewable energy conceptual simulation, SIREN, is used to calculate energy generation for renewable energy power stations using SAM models.

<h3>System Advisor Model (SAM)</h3>
<p>System Advisor Model (SAM) modules are used to perform energy calculations. The program uses the SAM SDK API (SSC Version: 45; Jun 30 2015)
<p>The System Advisor Model (&ldquo;Model&rdquo;) is provided by the National Renewable Energy Laboratory (&ldquo;NREL&rdquo;), which is operated by the Alliance for Sustainable Energy, LLC (&ldquo;Alliance&rdquo;) for the U.S. Department Of Energy (&ldquo;DOE&rdquo;) and may be used for any purpose whatsoever.
<p>SAM uses meteorological and solar data to model output of various renewable energy technologies. MERRA data is a suitable source to generate data files for input to SAM.
<h3>MERRA data</h3>
<p>The Modern Era Retrospective-analysis for Research and Applications (&ldquo;MERRA&rdquo;) is a NASA atmospheric data reanalysis for the satellite era using a major new version of the Goddard Earth Observing System Data Assimilation System Version 5 (GEOS-5). MERRA focuses on historical analyses of the hydrological cycle on a broad range of weather and climate time scales, and places the NASA EOS suite of observations in a climate context. This data is made available through the Global Modeling and Assimilation Office (GMAO) and the GES DISC.
<h3>SWIS Load and Other Data</h3>
<p>SIREN uses current load data to model system performance against actual load. The data is obtained from the Australian Energy Market Operator (AEMO; formerly from the Independent Market Operator, IMO).
The AEMO collects and collates a range of data relating to the Wholesale Electricity Market (WEM) within the South West Interconnected System (SWIS) in Western Australia.
